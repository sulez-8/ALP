#Predict and Run Example 1
 # Add comments to the code below to explain what it does

firstName = "Hassan"

print(firstName)
#python now recognizes firstname as a variable 
#Predict and Run Example 2
 # Add comments to the code below to explain what it does

lastName = "Gallaf"
#now it recognizes a second variable  
fullName = firstName + " " + lastName
#now it recognizes a 3rd variable that combines both of the previous variables
print(fullName)

#Predict and Run Example 3
 # Add comments to the code below to explain what it does

print("Hello " + firstName + ". Your full name is " + fullName + ".")
# now it will print out the variables and concatenate them with the string
